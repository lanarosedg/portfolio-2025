            When I’m not coding, I work with startups as a <br/>
            recruiter, helping hire skilled developers for various <br/>
            projects. <br/> <br/>
            I also teach C# at a college on Saturdays—not just <br/>
            to share my knowledge, but also to learn from my <br/>
            students and grow as a developer.
